**Implementing Schedulers in Minix3**

** Akshita Mittel

The main aim of this assignment is to understand the current Minix kernel and its scheduling algorithms. Based on the knowledge alter the current schedulers to implement our own algorithms, and test their performance in different situations. The two algorithms implemented are the Multi-level Feedback Queue and priority.

The performance test code is present in this directory.

The MFQ, and Priority are present in their directories along with their ReadMe.

The testing procedures are also mentioned in the directories itself.
